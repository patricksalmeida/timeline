# Airtable Engineering Assignment - Timeline component

- What you like about your implementation.\
In my implementation I solve the challenge using the pattern component composition, this approach turns possible to create reusable and flexible components, you can create frontend solutions like a Lego pieces.

- What you would change if you were going to do it again.\
I would implement a navigation system with arrows to show next and previews timeline items, probably this component would have a better usability, mainly in mobile devices.

- How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.\
To create this design I follow the [CodyHouse Horizontal Timeline](https://codyhouse.co/demo/horizontal-timeline/index.html) component, it's a minimalist implementation that seems very clean and sober.

- How you would test this if you had more time.\
I would test it with Jest and Cypress, but it depends of project requirements, the time-to-market sometimes it's more valueable than a full tested component.
